grey-handling
=============

Let's say you have full bags and you're in the middle of a dungeon, far from a vendor, or maybe underwater and about to drown or be ninja looted if you don't loot this corpse pretty fast! Even better, let's say you're playing with some teammates that have free bag spaces, and you want to give them the junkest, the least useful, valuable and expensive item of your inventory to be recognized as a good person, improving your reputation on your server.

Well, that's great because **this addon helps you to make these decisions more easily by displaying the price of your grey items on tooltip and making the less valuable grey items glow in your bags**! In addition, **it allows you to give to the players around you the opportunity to trade your most unprofitable grey items without wasting time writing**.

What it does?
-------------

- Displays in tooltip the price of items in your bags (especially useful on World of Warcraft Classic).
- Displays your cheapest grey items by making them glow to make it easier for you to know which item to throw away or trade to another player.

If the choice is too hard, the addon displays the two least valuable grey items glow in orange (the cheapest at the moment and the cheapest considering that its stack is full).

For example, you got in your bags 4 leather skin worth 20 pieces of coppers and 1 cloth robe worth 25 pieces of coppers. Individual leather skin is cheaper than the robe, but stacked leather skins are more valuable than the cloth robe that can't be stacked. Both items will glow in orange, giving you the final choice.

Compatibility with other bags addons
------------------------------------

- Everything works the same with **OneBag3**.
- The orange glow in **ArkInventory** is replaced with a bright yellow glow that is not removed by mouseover (close and open your bags until there is no more grey items to remove).
- The orange glow does not currently work work with **Inventorian**.

If your bag addon disables the orange glow, you can always activate the text explanation in options and looking for the item yourself (visually or with its name if the addon you are using has a search bar).
