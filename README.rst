grey-handling
=============

Say you're in a dungeon or far from a vendor, with full bags, you're underwater and
about to drown or be ninja looted if you don't loot this corpse pretty fast!  Or
maybe you have some teammates that have bag space around, and you want to give them
the shittiest, the least useful, and the least expensive object you have, to be a
good team player and increase your server reputation?

Well, this addon **aims to make decisions about your objects easier when you must
choose to part way with your greys**.

What it does
------------

- Displays the price of objects in your bags for Wow Classic.
- Selects your cheapest grey object, so you can exchange it or throw it away in one click.

If the choice is hard makes the two least profitable grey objects glow orange :

- One is the cheapest right now
- One is the cheapest if you go on exploring and stack everything to the max

Ie: Right now you have 4 destroyed skins worth 20 coppers, and some pierced cloth
boot only wearable by demonists, worth 25 coppers.
Destroyed skins are the cheapest right now because they're 20 coppers when the boots
are 25 coppers, but the boots are the cheapest later because they can't stack so they
will still be 25 copper, and a full stack of 20 destroyed skins is worth 1 silver.

Compatibility with other bags addons
------------------------------------

* Everything works the same with OneBag3
* The orange glow in ArkInventory is replaced by a bright yellow glow that is not removed by mouseover. (Launch again until there is no more grey to remove)
* The orange glow does not work with Inventorian (for now, I could makes it works if it's important for you)

If your bag addon break the orange glow, you can always activate the
text explanation in options and search for the item yourself visually
or with its name if your addon permit that.
