# grey-handling

This addon display the price of object in bag for Wow Classic.

It can also be activated with the ctrl key while holding shift in order to:
* Select the cheapest grey object, so you can exchange it or throw it away
with one click
* If the cheapest object is ambiguous it open your bad and make the two least
profitable grey objects glows orange in your bags:
    - One is the cheapeast right now (Ie : Right now you have 4 destroyed
    skins worth 20 coppers, max stack will be 20 for 1 silver)
    - One is the cheapest if you stack it to the max (Ie : Right now you
    have 10 shitty claws worth 40 copper, max stack will be 20 for
    80 coppers)

 Optionally it can :
 * Ask around if someone want to exchange the grey object if they have bag
 space left
 * Explain ambiguous choice for the cheapest object in your chat
 * Not display object price because you're playing retail and this is already
  done by the Wow client
